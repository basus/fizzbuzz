The FizzBuzz test has become popular as a way to weed out the 99.5% of
programmers who apparently can't program. The problem is simple:

> Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of
> three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print
> “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print
> “FizzBuzz”

Personally FizzBuzz is a little programming activity when I want to do some
quick hacking that isn't necessarily involved with any of my actual
projects. It's also a neat little beginning exercise when I'm learning a new
language.
